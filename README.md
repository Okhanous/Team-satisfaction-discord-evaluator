# Team satisfaction discord evaluator

This is a discord Bot created in an objectif to evaluate every Team's member spirit of a group project. The bot sends once a week a group of messages in order to evaluate chosen criterias : Motivation, Workload, Work environment, productivity.

Every member adds an evaluation from 0 to 10. These values are then stored in a JSON and graphical representations can be generated to check the variation of each of these criterias during the project. 

For each member we can generate a graphical representation of the evolution of each criteria during the project :
 - Motivation variation in respect of weeks
 - Workload variation in respect of weeks
 - Productivity variation in respect of weeks
 - Work environment variation in respect of weeks

We can also generate a summary one graph of the whole team's performance which is simply the mean of the values entered each week for each criteria.
